# DicePoke

The game is called "Dice Poker". The game is played by both humans and computers. The player places a bet on each round, and the computer rolls the dice. The player has a balance in their bank account that they can use to place their bets. In addition, the game gives the player a free 6$ to start with.

Before the user starts playing the first round, an interface prompts the user to enter a name. The user must enter a name in order to start the game. The player is prompted to enter their bet amount. If the user enters a bet amount between 1$ and 4$, then the computer rolls the dice.

In order to win points, the dice must have a sequential number. If the player wins, they will earn double their bet amount. If the computer rolls identical numbers, the player will earn triple the points; this is the highest hand. If the player loses, they will lose their bet money.

The game will stop after a certain point. I added a loop that stops the game if the user plays 5 rounds or if the player runs out of money. At the end of the game, a message will be displayed, indicating the reason why the game ended
